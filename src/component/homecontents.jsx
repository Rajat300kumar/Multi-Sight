            Mike Sheridan, and Patrick Naughton initiated the Java language
            project in June 1991.Java was originally designed for interactive
            television, but it was too advanced for the digital cable television
            industry at the time. I learn from course cube pvt.ltd. In this
            language i learn many this like JDBC.
